            OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES
        </h1>
        <p>One my favorites hobbies is to go hiking with my dog. 
        I enjoyed being in the nature because I can look at the birds, forest, animals and all the enviroment. 
        I consider this hobby as a relaxing way for my body due to the contact with the nature, and also helps my body to  release all the stress accumulated within my body. 
        I also enjoy enjoy running around the soccer field with my dog. My dog is still a puppy so has a lot of energy that she needs to let go, so I usually take her for a run, walking and dog park. Another hobbie that I enjoy is soccer. I like sport therefore, so often I go to the soccer field to play socce or I go to the basketball court to play basketball, and of course the company of my puppy cannot be missing.

            <h2>PHRASES</h2>
        <p>
        “Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity”
        ― John Muir, Our National Parks 
        “Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits.”
        ― Cindy Ross
